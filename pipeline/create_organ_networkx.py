#the overall role of this file is to read the mesh ascii file, downloadable from tehir website
#and output the largest network possible - in includes all "main letters" A-N, V and Z
#at a later point in the snakemake procedure, the network will be truncated
#the network that we create is really a number of separated networks, where the number is equal to the number of 
#letter+number firt combinations, that is, A01, A02,... Z13,

#for a single "string" such as "Leukocyte"
#the mesh network can have paths diverge (that reconverge) for a single A01
#it can also have multiple paths that never touch between different A01, A15, etc
#we create our network such that paths in a single A01 never reconverge
#this will create conveniences when we fetch instances of organs later down the line
